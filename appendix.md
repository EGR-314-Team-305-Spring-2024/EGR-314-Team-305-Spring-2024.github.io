# Team 305 Appendix

## Team Organization

**Team Goals:**
* Maintain consistent and productive work schedule
* Furthering passion of coding, like working with code repositories (github)
* Further knowledge in manufacturing process
* Advance knowledge in professional PCB design 
* Create a reliable and sturdy final product within the project requirements

**Communication Channels Table:**

![Alt text](pictures/Communication_Channels_Screenshot.png)

### Communucation Procedures

**How will your team communicate (e.g., group text, email, Canvas, Slack, Discord, telephone)? Consider the need for both asynchronous and synchronous discussion types, and the expectations that come with each mode of communication.**

Our team will be communicating primarily through text messaging. For meetings that require all members to be present, in person meeting is preferable but if all members can not attend, such meeting will be done via Discord.

**How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?**

Communication to the instructor will be handled via email in which the person will tag the rest of the team in the correspondence. 

### Meeting Schedule

In order for the team to conduct meetings, a text reminder will be sent out on the day of the meeting both a couple of hours prior and immediately before. Meetings will occur on a consistent agreed upon schedule. Assuming a meeting change happens in response to the relative workload required for a 314 assignment, changing meeting times will be discussed in class with a text sent out as a reminder. Under other circumstances, a discussion will be conducted via text in-order to determine a new meeting time. It is preferred that meetings happen face-to-face on the ASU Polytechnic campus though Zoom will be available as needed.

### Roles & Responsibilities 

![Alt text](pictures/Roles_and_Responsibilities_Screenshot.png)

For our team, project roles are to be picked voluntarily, and once assigned, they are to remain in that role unless there is an accommodation that is required that prevents them from satisfying said position. This should be communicated in advance. In such a scenario, a consensus will be reached among the team members for who is best capable to fulfill the role switch or the responsibilities of the role in question can be distributed among the different roles. However, if a role switch is not required but only assistance is, any role is allowed to assist at any time. 

Projects will be kept on track through the use of a Gantt chart via Smartsheet. And the team leader will be responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met among the team members. 

The current roles for the project are as follows:
* Meeting leader - **William Pena**
* Meeting recorder - **Anthony Alvarado**
* Assignment leader - **Princess Colon**
* Project monitor - **Cole Lackey**

**How often will you change project roles?**
* Every 3 weeks

**How will you decide who is assigned to each role?**
* We all picked initially what role we wanted to be and every three weeks we will rotate the roles by 1 downward. (Ex/ Current assignment leader will become the project monitor)

**How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities?**
* Team members can ask other group members for help when needed and every person in the group is expected to be supportive and encouraged. 

**How will you identify and respond to situations where the team must adjust roles and responsibilities?**
* Group discussions either through text, in-person meetings, or Zoom will determine any role changes if needed. 

**How will you track the team activities and milestones?**
* We will create a separate team meeting notes document.

**How will you assign technical responsibilities to team members?**
* Technical responsibilities will be included in the team Gantt chart and distributed among team members based on group discussions and individual strengths. 

### Team Coordination & Accountability

To complete assignments as a team, we will begin with a general meeting about what needs to be done. Outside of hard scheduled meet times, all team members can work on the project at any time. However, the assignment must be completed the day before, including the quality check. The assignment will then be submitted by the Meeting Recorder. To ensure the assignment is completed successfully all members will be required to report on which portion of the assignment they will best be able to assist. However, the final say will go to the Assignment Leader. Making sure everyone on the team is informed of the design review will fall under the task of the Project Monitor. 

For things referring to accountability and team conflict, it will be subject to the Conflict Resolution Protocol.

### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

_The team members agree to the following process for resolving conflicts with other team members:_

1) If, by 48 hours of initial contact by team leader, any member does not reply, they are to be removed from the corresponding assignment 

2) If, after two repeated violations of [1], the violating member is to be considered a missing participant, and to be removed indefinitely via pink slip until contact is reestablished. Assuring this on assignments shall fall under the jurisdiction of the Meeting Recorder

3) If, in the conditions where there is a conflict among members, a meeting will be scheduled at the next available time to resolve said conflict. Planning meetings will be done by the Meeting Leader position and hosted on the platform Zoom

4) Conflicts regarding project course decisions are to be voted anonymously. If consensus is unable to be met during the meet times established by the Project Planner, decision making power shall be deferred to the Team Leader Position

5) For intrapersonal team conflict, Article 3 is invoked at the next possible meeting time disregarding any preset assignments. If there is no resolution to which all parties are satisfied, it is to be referred to the professor or TA of the course for further action. This can be done by any member. 

6) Team decisions related to conflict resolution and student participation are to be made via vote, including the approval of this protocol which shall be done unanimously.

7) Any debate to change this protocol can be started by any present participant.

Assembly is easy, please follow the instructions provided…  “

**Positive Comment 1:**

_“... Installation was easy, and the mounting bracket, arm, and base give you lots of options for horizontal or vertical, on either a flat surface or on a pole. Since we had the last one up high on a pole above the fence, we did the same thing here is it worked out very easily._

_The base unit readout screen is nice, good contrast, lots of information on it, more than we had on the last one. It hasn't rained yet, so we haven't seen how that works yet, but the rest of it has been effective, in comparison to our neighbors and some other readouts we have available nearby. Setting all the options along with date, time, and measurement/unit preferences was quick and easy._

_Getting the station and base unit to link up was simple and easy without any problems following the quick start instructions…”_

**Positive Comment 2:**

_“There are a great number of weather stations on the market that provide a varying range of data. Finding one that targets what you need can be daunting if not exhausting by the time you do all the research. I depend on solar panels to power my home and needed a unit that, along with the basic weather data, could provide sun radiation readings to compare to the panel array performance. My aim was to find something easy to operate but still provide key weather data that was reliable, consistent and affordable. After researching the available units I purchased the Sainlogic 089. Keep in mind that any weather station won’t stand a chance of providing accurate data if you don’t follow the instructions. The user manual provided sufficient details (and pictures) to make the installation easy. We were up and running with a connection to an online weather channel within an hour.”_

**Negative Comment 1:**

_“The setup on this product was fairly straightforward. Didn't have any problems there. What I've found is that the outdoor temperature is fairly accurate down to about freezing temperatures. Then it starts to diverge. By the time the temperature is in the teens, it measures 4 degrees warmer than it really is. The reason I know this is that I have two other already proven sensors strapped to the pole of the sainlogic and have observed consistent data supporting this conclusion. Because it doesn't measure 4 degrees difference across all temperatures, I can't add an calibration factor that the device allows. That is a nice feature by the way, but not useful in this case._

_The other big complaint I have is that the anemometer stops working with accumulating snow. Yesterday we only received 2 inches of snow and it prevented it from working. The direction still works because that is not obstructed by accumulating snow, but the gust and average speed does not work until the snow melts. This is a poor mechanical design. I've owned other weather stations in this same home and they do not have this problem.”_

_“This weather station worked for a couple of months, then stopped transmitting the outside temperature, wind speed and rainfall. We changed the batteries, went out and bought expensive lithium batteries and the reset button on the unit stayed red, never green like it’s supposed to be!
It worked long enough for it to no longer be covered by Amazon or its seller. As a matter of fact, it doesn’t even come with a warranty! So I again, urge you not to WASTE your money!”_

We have it where our old weather station was for years (different company). Tried reaching out for customer support and got no response. Display doesn’t show feels like temp or past rainfall without going through elaborate steps. In the cold north the feels like temp is important. Crap station and would not recommend. Unfortunately past the point of returning so stuck with it. Guess I’m buying a rain gauge.”_

**Positive Comment 1:**

_"I just love these units. I have purchased four to date. One for a gift, one for each of my two houses, and one I left behind in a previously owned house. The base station does work on battery but I plugged mine in for brighter display. I use Cord Mate brand wire covers to hide the power cable. The home base battery kicks in during a power loss. The outside sensor is meant to be protect from direct rain but mine out totally outside in the elements for over two years (Oh Oh, I may have just voided my warrantee). One is in Maine with snow and rain). One in California in blistering heat and rain. Would I buy it again. Yes, I have again and again."_

**Positive Comment 2:**

_"This is a HUGE upgrade from the piece of junk I bought from Walmart a few years ago. The display is bright and the remote sensor worked as soon as I put in the batteries. The one this replaced always had a problem communicating with the sensor and the past few months I was going through batteries like crazy. This one at least has an AC adapter and just that feature alone makes it worth buying it. There are videos on YouTube that show how to set this up too, in case you don't like to read directions._

_Two and half year update: I bought this in April 2017 and if worked flawlessly. I've only had to change the batteries once in that time until recently. Just a few days ago I had to change the batteries again. After jumping through all the hoops to do that to make it work again (take out the batteries from both the station and remote, unplug the station, press any button at least 20 times and leave it unplugged for 15 minutes), which there is no documentation on unless you happen to find this instruction on their youtube channel, my remote only works for a day or two and I have to repeat the process. So it's clear to me I have to buy either a new remote for over $25 of a new station and remote for $65. Yes, two and a half years is a long time but I think this should have lasted a lot longer since there are no moving parts, just electronics. The remote doesn't even look water proof since when I first opened it a few days ago, there was water in it. You'd think they'd make these things water proof, or at least water resistant. But oh, you can buy"_

_"Very disappointed. The outside sensor only worked for a week or 2 before it died. I had even bought the ridiculously expensive plastic cage that is supposed to shield the sensor from the elements. I don't know if it didn't work or if the sensor was so crappy that no amount of protection was going to keep it alive. I've replaced the batteries with new ones and cannot resuscitate the sensor — it's dead, Jim._

_I bought this weather station because I had another La Crosse weather station (different model) at my previous house and it had worked perfectly for over 5 years. This one barely made it to 5 days. I already have several devices which tell me the indoor temperature and humidity — I bought this for the outside info — exactly what it's not giving me._

_I'm certain I can't return this to Amazon at this point since only the indoor unit hasn't been exposed to the weather. I'm thoroughly disgusted at this point at the money I've wasted on this La Crosse product! Never again!"_

_"Looks good but not very accurate. I have 3 other digital thermometers, I put them all side by side and let them stabilize for an hour. The Lacrosse Indoor temp read 80.8 degrees and all the others read 79.5 exactly ( the other 3 read exactly the same and they were different manufacturers). I even have one that reads Celsius, converting C to F came to 79.5 degrees. The Lacrosse unit reads 1.3 degrees too high. Also the Indoor humidity is off as well, the Lacrosse reads 42%, all of the others read 49%. The Outdoor temp on the LaCrosse read within .1 degree of the other units but the Humidity reading is way off. The other 3 units read between 61% to 63%, the Lacrosse reads 53%. Not very accurate but it looks good..
UPDATE - the power adapter died after 3 days, I'm sending it back to Amazon."_

I wanted to set this on a piece of furniture in my bedroom and be able to see it when in bed at night. You have to stand up to be at an angle to actually see the numbers. I would send it back, but threw the box that it came in away and didn't set it up immediately. Dumb on my part thinking it would work. We had another one that worked perfect, but the lights on it have dimmed so much, you can't see it, but it is very old. Don't order, you will be disappointed,"_
