### Communucation Procedures

**How will your team communicate (e.g., group text, email, Canvas, Slack, Discord, telephone)? Consider the need for both asynchronous and synchronous discussion types, and the expectations that come with each mode of communication.**

Our team will be communicating primarily through text messaging. For meetings that require all members to be present, in person meeting is preferable but if all members can not attend, such meeting will be done via Discord.

**How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?**

Communication to the instructor will be handled via email in which the person will tag the rest of the team in the correspondence.
