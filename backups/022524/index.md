# MWMS (Mobile Weather Monitoring Solutions)


Team 305 Arizona State University, EGR 314 (Class #17878), Professor: Kevin Nichols


## Our Team

**Members:** Anthony Alvarado, Princess Colon, Cole Lackey, William Pena

**Mission Statement:** _Our team’s goal is to create a flexible solution to remote weather data monitoring and logging for people in rural communities and territories._

**Team Charter**: Our mission as MWMS is to create a dynamic and collaborative environment where we maintain a consistent and productive work schedule, cultivate a passion for coding and collaboration using code repositories like GitHub, deepen our understanding of manufacturing processes, advance our knowledge in professional PCB design, and collectively deliver reliable and sturdy final products that exceed project requirements.

**Project Description**: "This semester we will be producing systems that can respond to the environment using serial sensing and actuation in your system for a mobile weather station. Each team will also broadcast their environmental data to the internet over WiFi using the MQTT protocol."

Our team was tasked with developing a mobile weather station that would be capable of measuring at least two different environmental variables, including but not limited to: 
* Temperature
* rainfall
* Humidity
* Atmospheric pressure
* Windspeed

In addition to monitoring the eviorment, we were required to utilize an actuator who's movement would be based on data collected by our sensors. 

## Developing User Needs and Requirments

With the ladder project requirements in mind, we moved on to delevop user needs and requirements for our product based on generated user needs. **(Workshop this)**

### User Needs

**Steps Involved in our User Needs Process: (WORKSHOP THIS)**

1. Gather knowledge and generate user needs based on current industrial products **(WORKSHOP THIS)**

2. Sort user needs into categories: 
    1. Data based
    2. Location based
    3. General

3. Ranked User Needs

**Unexpected User Needs:** 
1. Battery lubricant
2. Fan aspirated temperature sensor
3. **ADD MORE HERE**

### Product Requirements

* Identify Stakeholders
    * Park Rangers/ National Park Associations
    * Camping/ Hiking Clubs
    * Petroleum Companies
    * Farmers
* Brainstormed possible Use Cases based on identified stakeholders
* Brainstormed Product Requirements based on User Needs
    * The product must require no prior training to deploy
    * Display “Feels Like” Temperatures
    * The device must be transportable by an average human
* Rank generated product requirments

## Design Ideation

**Key Design Concepts:** 
* Solar panel
* Temperature Sensor
* Humidity Sensor
* Removable Padded Backpack
* “Camalback” - sized body
* Poles for Mounting Body
* Sensor API Modules **(MAYBE REMOVE THIS?)**

### Prototype Design: Mobile Backpack Weahter Station

<img src="/pictures/prototype_1a.png" alt="Mobile Backpack Weahter Station" width="60%" height="60%">

With these guidelines in mind, we are currently developing a transportable weather station that one could comfortably wear as a backpack so that they could assemble it in a location of their choosing.
