										“The setup on this product was fairly straightforward. Didn't have any problems there. 
										What I've found is that the outdoor temperature is fairly accurate down to about freezing temperatures. 
										Then it starts to diverge. By the time the temperature is in the teens, it measures 4 degrees warmer than it really is. 
										The reason I know this is that I have two other already proven sensors strapped to the pole of the sainlogic 
										and have observed consistent data supporting this conclusion. 
										Because it doesn't measure 4 degrees difference across all temperatures, I can't add an calibration factor that the device allows. 
										That is a nice feature by the way, but not useful in this case. <br><br>
										The other big complaint I have is that the anemometer stops working with accumulating snow. 
										Yesterday we only received 2 inches of snow and it prevented it from working. 
										The direction still works because that is not obstructed by accumulating snow, 
										but the gust and average speed does not work until the snow melts. This is a poor mechanical design.

										I just love these units. I have purchased four to date. One for a gift, one for each of my two houses,

										during a power loss. The outside sensor is meant to be protect from direct rain but mine out totally outside in

										This is a HUGE upgrade from the piece of junk I bought from Walmart a few years ago. 
										The display is bright and the remote sensor worked as soon as I put in the batteries. 
										The one this replaced always had a problem communicating with the sensor and the past few 
										months I was going through batteries like crazy. This one at least has an AC adapter and just that 
										feature alone makes it worth buying it. There are videos on YouTube that show how to set this up too,
										 in case you don't like to read directions. <br><br>
										 Two and half year update: I bought this in April 2017 and if worked flawlessly. 
										 I've only had to change the batteries once in that time until recently. 
										 Just a few days ago I had to change the batteries again. After jumping through all the hoops 
										 to do that to make it work again (take out the batteries from both the station and remote, unplug 
										 the station, press any button at least 20 times and leave it unplugged for 15 minutes), 
										 which there is no documentation on unless you happen to find this instruction on their youtube channel, 
										 my remote only works for a day or two and I have to repeat the process. 
										 So it's clear to me I have to buy either a new remote for over $25 of a new station and remote for $65. 
										 Yes, two and a half years is a long time but I think this should have lasted a lot longer since 
										 there are no moving parts, just electronics. The remote doesn't even look water proof since when I 
										 first opened it a few days ago, there was water in it. You'd think they'd make these things water proof, 
										 or at least water resistant. But oh, you can buy

										Very disappointed. The outside sensor only worked for a week or 2 before it died.

										I have several wireless thermometers. My main complaint with them is the lack of accuracy. 
										I did some research and found the product line from Ambient Weather. I bought this one because 
										it came with the wireless temperature sensor for the pool, as well as a thermometer/hygrometer outdoor 
										sensor. <br><br>
										I read the other reviews on Amazon and saw that many people expressed extreme frustration with the 
										setup of the device. I experienced none of those frustrations. I have quite a bit of experience setting 
										up similar devices such as WiFi-connected garage door openers, doorbells, cameras, and other weather gateways. 
										That experience helped for sure. I also work in information technology and so my technical skills are probably 
										higher than the average person. <br><br>
										Regardless of technical skill level, the setup of this device is actually very straightforward as long as you 
										follow the instructions carefully. <br><br>
										The key to setting up this device is connecting your computer to the device's internal WiFi access point. 
										That is how you connect your computer (or smart phone) to the device during initial setup. 
										Then you put in the information for your own WiFi so the device can then connect to your network and from 
										there, to the internet. <br><br>
										You don't have to set up the wunderground.com and ambientweather.net if you don't want to. 
										But it's easy and kind of fun. So record the MAC address that is shown when you connect to the 
										configuration page of the device, or just look on the back for the sticker that has a number 
										such as "00:AB:12:34:CD:EF" and then head over and register an account and your device there. 
										Then fill out the appropriate fields on the device while you're setting it up. <br><br>
										It did take me two tries to get my device connected to my home WiFi. 
										But the entire setup process probably took about 30 minutes. <br><br>
										I did run into a little trouble with the sensors. One of them kept coming up as "Er" in the display.
										I ended up removing the batteries, changing the channel, and reinserting the batteries. 
										(If you change the channel, you have to remove and reinsert the batteries in order to get it to actually 
										change the channel.) After a bit of minor fiddling, the device was able to receive data from both of the 
										sensors and also send data to the two websites. I installed the Ambient Weather app, 
										signed in with my account and now I see the data displayed on my phone as well. <br><br>
										I've only had this device up and running since last night, but it's dialed-in and working perfectly. <br><br>
										Don't let the negative reviews deter you if you have some technical wherewithal and the ability to follow 
										instructions carefully. You will likely have no serious problems. <br><br>
										A word of caution regarding the water-resistant pool temperature probe: Make sure that the o-ring is 
										carefully pressed into the groove in the top part of the casing. It would be a good idea to use some 
										silicone grease as well. The o-ring may pop out of the groove when you open the case to insert the batteries
										or change the radio channel. Be very careful to ensure that you replace it properly or your device could fill 
										with water and cause damage.

										This is the 2nd time we bought this. The first time I put the pool sensor in my hot tub once pool 
										season was over. I'm not sure if they warn against this or not. But it didn't last long in the 105 
										degree hot tub. I'm guessing it has more to do with the humidity with the cover on...but don't make the

										Last winter I vacationed in Florida the month of January. When I returned to Wisconsin my hot tub was nearly frozen over. 
										Luckily I was able to get a technician out to replace a circulating pump before any damage was done to the piping. <br><br>
										Before going to Florida this year I searched for a wi-fi enabled thermometer that I could access while in Florida. 
										I found very little information on available systems. Comments on the Ambient Weather System did not give me comfort 
										that the signal would penetrate the 5in. cover so I decided to wing it. 
										A week before we were to leave I made a last minute decision to purchase this system and see how it worked. 
										When I set it up, the signal was received by the receiver and I could monitor temperature via the internet. <br><br>
										The first week in Florida I logged on and saw the temperature was dropping. 
										I had a neighbor go check on the hot tub and the breaker was tripped and would not reset. 
										The technician came out and replaced a defective heater. A week later the same situation occurred and again I called the technician. 
										Turns out he had jostled the hot tub plug and the water level dropped shutting off the hot tub. <br><br>
										Without this product I would have had thousands of dollars in damages and probably would have had to replace the tub. 
										I'm back in Wisconsin in February and everything is a little better when you have a hot tub.

										I bought it for the API, so that I could automate things based on the temperature.

										is obnoxious because I didn't want to do that. <br><br>
										Eventually, the outside thermometer stopped working. I've been using the pool thermometer as an 
										outside thermometer. That worked for awhile, but the base station loses it more and more often lately,

										I ultimately just bit the bullet and bought an ESP8266, put micropython on it, 
										and hooked up a set of temperature sensors off Amazon. 
										I had really wanted to avoid rolling my own, hence buying this item. Turns out, 
										it was super easy to wire up my own sensor and hook it up to a free grafana account. 
										Way more reliable and a fraction the cost, and I have a pool and outside sensor.

										I tried to get help from support, they were annoying and unhelpful. I bought my first of these about 
										2 years ago. It worked till the batteries died, when I replaced the batteries it immediately died. My bad, 
										I thought. Got a new floaty sensor thing, same story.... worked till batteries died, 
										was super careful to follow instructions with replacing the batteries, used the right lube, 
										dies within a couple days of putting it back in the water. I tried a 3rd time! I really like it, 
										I really wanted it to work. This time the batteries didn't even die. I live close to their office, 
										thinking about returning their trash in person. <br>
										Tldr wonderful device, except it only last ~6 months.

										The overall design of the MKIIIRTI-LR is nice but for this price and with the large solar panel and good sized battery,

										“Bought the La Crosse Technology V21-WTH unit about 3 weeks ago and it is working perfectly so far. 
										Had some crazy weather for this area and all the functions reported properly. 
										The accuracy of temp and humidity appears to be consistent. As compared to a separate wireless 
										thermometer the readings pair consistently. Setup was a bit tricky getting the weather station to 
										pair with my iPhone. Had to go to their web site for problem solving. Quickly found the fix and all good from there. 
										The display has several brightness settings from off to high and clarity/readability are good. 
										The anemometer is mounted @ 50 feet straight line of site from the base unit atop the rear fence. 
										The temp/humidity sensor about 25 feet away protected by the patio cover. 
										No signal issues as these sensors have much further range especially if unobstructed. 
										Will take time to figure out how long the 2 size C batteries for the anemometer last before needing replacement. 
										I've seen a post that suggests it's in the 3 month range but that was in some sub-zero weather.”
